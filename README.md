## Introduction

The **Response Insight Analysis System (RIAS)** is an advanced platform designed to enhance faculty-student interactions through data-driven feedback mechanisms. It empowers students to provide detailed feedback on lectures, instructors, and the overall educational environment while offering administrators and faculty members actionable insights into teaching performance, student engagement, and academic improvement strategies.

The platform includes secure, role-based dashboards for students, faculty, and administrators to manage and analyze feedback, generate reports, and track progress in a user-friendly interface.

## Features

### For Students
- **Role-Based Secure Login:** Students can securely log in and access their personalized dashboard.
- **Feedback Submission:** Students submit daily feedback on classes, teachers, and teaching methods. Absent students are restricted from submitting feedback.
- **Timetable Integration:** Students can view their pre-loaded class schedules, including faculty and subject details.
- **Reward System:** Points are awarded for daily feedback submissions. These points can be redeemed for academic credits.
- **Monthly Surveys:** Participate in surveys about changes in teaching methods and campus environment. 

### For Faculty
- **Feedback Review:** Faculty can review detailed, time-filtered feedback (daily, weekly, monthly) submitted by students.
- **Performance Reports:** Faculty members can generate and export performance reports to identify areas for improvement.
- **Comparative Analysis:** Faculty can compare their feedback with class averages to gain a clearer perspective on teaching effectiveness.

### For Admin
- **Administrative Dashboard:** Admins can access and manage all student and faculty feedback.
- **Anti-Ragging System:** A dedicated anti-ragging feature allows students to report issues directly to admins.
- **Data Analytics:** Admins receive AI-powered insights and predictive analysis reports on faculty performance and student engagement trends.
- **Detailed Reporting:** Generate exportable reports, including charts and tables, on faculty performance, student feedback, and trends over time.

## Technology Stack

**Frontend:**
- React.js (for component-based UI development)
- Redux (for state management)
- HTML5/CSS3, Bootstrap (for responsive design)
- Chart.js and D3.js (for data visualization)

**Backend:**
- Node.js (runtime environment)
- Express.js (for API routing)
- JWT (for secure authentication)
- MongoDB (NoSQL database for storing feedback, user data, etc.)

**Data Science & Analytics:**
- Python (for machine learning, data processing)
- scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy (for predictive analytics)

**Version Control:**
- Git and GitHub (for version control and collaboration)

## System Architecture

The **RIAS** system is built using the **MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)**. The system utilizes role-based access control (RBAC) for managing permissions between student, faculty, and admin roles. Below is an overview of the architecture:

1. **Frontend**: Built with React.js, offering a responsive and dynamic user interface for students, faculty, and admins.
2. **Backend**: Node.js + Express.js handles API requests, authentication, and business logic.
3. **Database**: MongoDB stores user data, feedback submissions, schedules, and reports.
4. **Machine Learning**: Python-based predictive models analyze feedback data for trends, insights, and reports.

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4. Set up environment variables in a `.env` file (example below):
    ```plaintext
    MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/rias-db
    JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
    PORT=5000
    ```
5. Start the backend server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

### Frontend Setup

1. Clone the frontend repository:
    ```bash
